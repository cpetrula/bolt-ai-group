Bolt AI Group – Salon AI Assistant (MVP Spec)
1. Project Overview

Goal:
Build a multi-tenant web application for hair salons where each salon gets a virtual AI assistant that:

Answers calls

Sets, modifies, and cancels appointments

Provides pricing and duration info

Checks availability

Checks when specific hairdressers are working

Answers basic FAQ about hours and services

The app is designed to later support other business types (plumbers, electricians, etc.), so the architecture should be multi-tenant and business-type agnostic.

2. Tech Stack

Backend:

Node.js (TypeScript preferred for type safety)

Framework: Express or Fastify

Database: MySQL (multi-tenant friendly schema)

ORM: Prisma or TypeORM (pick one and use migrations)

Auth: JWT-based session tokens + 2FA (TOTP via e.g. speakeasy / otplib)

Background jobs: BullMQ / custom job queue (for async tasks, webhooks, SMS/email sending)

Frontend:

Vue 3 (Composition API)

Vite (build tool)

Vue Router (SPA routing)

Pinia (state management)

PrimeVue (UI components)

Tailwind CSS (styling utility classes)

Telephony & AI:

Phone numbers & call/SMS: Twilio

Unique phone number per customer (salon)

Webhooks for inbound calls and SMS

Voice & conversational AI (options; wire for easy swapping):

Vapi (for call orchestration)

OpenAI (for LLM / NLU)

ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS for voice

Design for pluggable AI provider (e.g., AiProvider interface).

Billing & Subscriptions:

Payment processor suggestion: Stripe

Recurring billing: monthly and yearly plans

Webhooks: subscription created/updated/canceled

Store subscription status in DB

4. Business & Subscription Logic
4.1 Subscription Plans

Monthly plan

Price: $295 / month

Yearly plan

20% less than 12 months:

12 × 295 = 3540 → 20% off = 2832

Price: $2,832 / year

Each customer (tenant) has:

Current subscription plan

Billing period (monthly/yearly)

Subscription status: trialing | active | past_due | canceled

Stripe (or other) subscription/customer IDs

4.2 Billing Flows

On signup:

Create customer record in DB

Redirect to Stripe Checkout / billing portal

On successful payment (Stripe webhook):

Mark tenant as active

Trigger onboarding flow:

Create Twilio phone number

Seed default services (haircut, color, etc.)

Seed default hours (optional)

Create demo “admin” user

Cancellation:

From portal, owner can cancel subscription → call billing API → cancel in Stripe → update DB.

Recurring billing:

Handled by Stripe; webhooks keep DB in sync.

5. Core Features & User Stories
5.1 Public Website

Home Page

Professional modern design.

Above-the-fold hero section:

Clear statement of value (simple language).

Prominent demo phone number to call (Twilio number pointing to demo salon).

Example copy (can be refined in code):

Your AI assistant:

Never calls out sick

Is never in a bad mood

Can answer multiple calls at the same time

How It Works Page

Explain:

They receive a unique phone number to forward their existing line to.

Calls to that number are handled by the AI assistant.

They get access to an admin portal:

Manage employees

Manage services

View appointments and reports

FAQ Page

Common questions:

“How does the AI answer calls?”

“Can I customize my services and prices?”

“How do I cancel?”

“Is it safe and secure?”

5.2 Admin Portal (Per Tenant)

Once logged in, each customer sees only their own data (multi-tenant isolation).

Capabilities:

7. AI & Telephony Workflow
7.1 Call Flow (High Level)

Customer calls salon’s Twilio number.

Twilio hits backend webhook:

Identify tenant by to_number.

Forward call into AI pipeline (e.g., Vapi + OpenAI + TTS).

AI answers with a pleasant greeting, e.g.:

“Hi, thanks for calling [Salon Name]. I’m your virtual assistant. How can I help you today?”

AI understands intent:

Book appointment

Modify appointment

Cancel appointment

Ask about hours

Ask about services/pricing

AI interacts with backend via HTTP APIs:

GET /api/availability?tenant_id=...

POST /api/appointments

PATCH /api/appointments/:id

DELETE /api/appointments/:id

GET /api/services

GET /api/hours

When an appointment is created/modified/canceled:

Store/update record in appointments.

Send confirmation SMS to customer (Twilio).

Send SMS and email notifications to designated employees (owner/manager by default).

Log call in call_logs with call_reason.

If canceled, store cancel_reason (AI asks in friendly way and sends to API).

7.2 AI Training & Configuration

For each tenant:

Store configuration/profile:

Business name

Default greeting

Business hours

Services (names, prices, durations)

Preferred tone (friendly, professional, etc.)

This configuration is passed to the AI provider as context on each call.

AI provider integration (example design):

Backend exposes endpoints the AI can call:

/api/ai/availability

/api/ai/appointments

/api/ai/services

AI is configured with a tool/skills schema that maps user intent → HTTP calls.

8. Frontend Pages (Vue + PrimeVue + Tailwind)

Public:

/ – HomePage

/signup – SignUpPage

/login – LoginPage

/forgot-password – ForgotPasswordPage

/how-it-works – HowItWorksPage

/faq – FAQPage

Authenticated (under /app):

/app – Dashboard (overview stats, next appointments, quick links)

/app/employees – EmployeesPage

/app/services – ServicesPage

/app/appointments – AppointmentsPage (calendar + list)

/app/billing – BillingPage

/app/reports – ReportsPage

/app/settings – SettingsPage (business profile, greeting, notification preferences)

Use PrimeVue for forms, tables, dialogs, date/time pickers, and Tailwind utilities for spacing, layout, and branding.

9. Logo & Branding

Company Name: Bolt AI Group

Initial simple approach (for Copilot/placeholder):

logo.svg:

Clean logotype “Bolt AI Group” with a simple bolt icon.

favicon.ico:

Simplified bolt icon, flat design.

Later, you can refine via a designer or AI image tool.

10. Demo Salon Setup

Create a seeded demo tenant for the public “try it now” phone number on the home page:

Tenant: Demo Salon

Twilio number: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (real number configured in Twilio)

Seed:

Common services and prices

A few stylists with schedules

AI config tuned to a generic salon.

Calls to the demo number go through the same AI pipeline, but always mapped to the demo tenant.

11. Common Salon Service Seed Data (Example)

Seed into services and service_addons for new tenants (customizable later):

Women’s Haircut – $75 – 60 min

Men’s Haircut – $50 – 45 min

Kids’ Haircut – $40 – 45 min

Blowout – $60 – 45 min

Full Color – $150 – 120 min

Root Touch-Up – $95 – 90 min

Partial Highlights – $160 – 120 min

Full Highlights – $220 – 150 min

Deep Conditioning Treatment (addon) – $30 – 20 min

Olaplex Treatment (addon) – $40 – 20 min

12. Example API Endpoints (for Copilot)

Backend REST skeleton (to help Copilot generate controllers/services):

POST   /api/auth/signup
POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/forgot-password
POST   /api/auth/reset-password
POST   /api/auth/2fa/setup

GET    /api/tenant/settings
PATCH  /api/tenant/settings

# Employees

13. Copilot-Friendly Task Breakdown

You can create GitHub issues from these:

Backend Setup

Initialize Node.js + TypeScript + Express/Fastify.

Configure MySQL + ORM.

Implement multi-tenant middleware (derive tenant_id from authenticated user or Twilio number).

Auth & 2FA

Sign up, login, JWT, password reset.

TOTP or SMS 2FA.

Tenant & Subscription

Models for tenants and subscriptions.

Stripe integration: checkout + webhooks.

Employees & Services

CRUD endpoints.

Schedules and mapping employees ↔ services.

Appointments & Availability

Availability computation.

Appointment CRUD + conflict checks.

Telephony Integration

Twilio webhooks.

Number provisioning for new tenants.

SMS notifications.

AI Integration

Design AiProvider interface.

Initial integration with Vapi/OpenAI (or other).

Implement API endpoints used by AI for bookings.

Frontend SPA

Vite + Vue + Tailwind + PrimeVue scaffold.

Public pages (Home, Signup, Login, How It Works, FAQ).

Authenticated dashboard & admin pages.

Reporting

Call logs and appointment stats.

Basic charts/tables on frontend.

Branding

Basic logo/favicon placeholders.

Apply consistent Bolt AI Group styling.

14. Assumptions (You Can Adjust Later)

Single time zone per tenant (no multi-location/time-zone handling in MVP).

No double-booking of employees (simple conflict detection).

AI calls backend via HTTPS (no direct DB access).

Stripe is the main billing provider (others can be added later).
