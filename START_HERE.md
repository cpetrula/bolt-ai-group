**Easiest Method**: Create issues directly from GitHub web interface:

1. Go to **[Actions tab](../../actions)**
2. Click **"Create GitHub Issues from README"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** → Type `create` → Click **"Run workflow"**

## ⚡ Alternative: Command Line Method

```bash
# 1. Get your GitHub token from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Create a token with 'repo' scope

./quick-start.sh
```

**That's it!** All 16 issues + 9 labels will be created automatically.

## 🚀 Four Ways to Create Issues

### Method 1: GitHub Actions (Easiest - No Command Line!) ⭐

**Perfect if you don't have terminal access or don't want to run bash commands.**

1. Go to [Actions tab](../../actions)
2. Select "Create GitHub Issues from README"
3. Click "Run workflow" → Type `create` → Run
4. Wait ~60 seconds
5. Done!

**Pros**: No local setup, runs on GitHub, no tokens needed
**Requires**: Nothing! Works from your browser

See **[GITHUB_ACTIONS_GUIDE.md](GITHUB_ACTIONS_GUIDE.md)** for detailed instructions.

### Method 2: Quick Start Script

```bash
export GH_TOKEN=your_token_here
./quick-start.sh
```

**Pros**: Automated, checks prerequisites, user-friendly
**Requires**: Python 3, PyGithub (auto-installed), terminal access

### Method 3: Python Script Directly

```bash
pip install PyGithub
export GH_TOKEN=your_token_here
python3 create_github_issues.py
```

**Pros**: Direct execution, full control
**Requires**: Python 3, PyGithub, terminal access

### Method 4: Bash Script with GitHub CLI (Alternative - Partial)

> **Note**: This bash script includes a subset of issues. For complete creation of all 16 issues, use Method 1, 2, or 3.

```bash
gh auth login
./create-issues.sh
```

**Pros**: Uses official GitHub CLI
**Requires**: GitHub CLI (gh)
**Note**: Creates labels + subset of issues

## ✅ After Creating Issues

Once the script completes:

1. **View your issues**: https://github.com/cpetrula/bolt-ai-group/issues
2. **Create a project board** to organize the work
3. **Set milestones** (e.g., MVP, Beta, v1.0)
4. **Assign team members** to issues
5. **Start with foundational epics** (Backend Infrastructure, Frontend Application)

---

## 🎓 Issue Structure

Every issue includes:

✅ **Clear title** with [EPIC] prefix for epics
✅ **Detailed description** of what needs to be done
✅ **Acceptance criteria** as a checklist
✅ **Required files/directories** to create
✅ **Dependencies** on other issues
✅ **API endpoints** (for backend issues)
✅ **Appropriate labels** for categorization

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Problem**: "GitHub token not found"
**Solution**: Set the token: `export GH_TOKEN=your_token`

**Problem**: "PyGithub not found"
**Solution**: Install it: `pip install PyGithub`

**Problem**: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Make script executable: `chmod +x quick-start.sh`

**Problem**: "Can't find repository"
**Solution**: Check your token has 'repo' scope
